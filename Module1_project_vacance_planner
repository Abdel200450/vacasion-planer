    /* You may have noticed some of our math has produced numbers with lots of decimal places, making then not look very nice. In this part, you need to go back and clean up those answers so they each only have 2 decimal places.

     To do this you are going to use a combination of ints and doubles.

     First, multiply the number you want to reformat by 100.
     Cast the result of part 1 to an int like so:
     (  int) answerFromOne
     This will drop any decimal places 3. Convert your answer back to a double, and move the decimal place over by 2 numbers like so:

     answerFromTwo / 100.0
     If you follow the above steps you should find that any of your answers are not limited to only 2 decimal places, however, those decimal places won’t be rounded, they will just be the first two from the original answer.

     This code will need to be added to each of the methods you wrote for parts II, III and IV.*/
